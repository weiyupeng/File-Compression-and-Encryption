How to create a basic blog in Django » Starting your application

Navigate to your project directory, this should contain a __init__.py, manage.py, settings.py and urls.py. There may also be a few others. For reference, my project name is djangorocks, you will need to replace any references to djangorocks throughout this tutorial.

Type the following into terminal, this creates a new application folder & key files we will be using for our blog.

python manage.py startapp blog

You should now have a folder called blog containing 3 files: __init__.py, models.py and views.py.

Important

Open up your settings.py, this is located in your project folder. Find INSTALLED_APPS and add 'blog'. You should have something similar to the following;

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'djangorocks.blog',
)

Django now knows about your new application, all thats left to do is create it.
